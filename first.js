7. avaScript naming conventions

        Names are case-sensitive, lowercase and uppercase are different.
        Start variable names with a letter, use camelCase for names.
        Variable names should be self-descriptive, describing the stored value.
        Boolean variables are usually prefixed with is or has .

         Arthmetic operators in JavaScript include:

        Addition (+)
        Subtraction (-)
        Multiplication (*)
        Exponentiation (**)
        Modulus (%)
        Decrement (--)
        Increment (++)
        Division (/)

        Operator	    Example	          Same As
            +=	        x += y	        x = x + y
            -=	        x -= y	        x = x - y
            *=	        x *= y	        x = x * y
            /=	        x /= y	        x = x / y

 10. parseInt, ParseFloat

        parseFloat()	

        considers the decimal point and the digits coming after it	
        Example - parseFloat() of "3.99" would be 3.99

        parseInt()

        3. parseInt() ignores the decimal point and even the digits coming after it
         example - parseInt of "3.99" would be 3.
